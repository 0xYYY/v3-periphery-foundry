Details: Same as SelfPermit but not abstract

## Methods
### selfPermit
```solidity
selfPermit(address token, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external payable
```
Details: Same as SelfPermit but not abstract
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| token | address | The address of the token spent |
| value | uint256 | The amount that can be spent of token |
| deadline | uint256 | A timestamp, the current blocktime must be less than or equal to this timestamp |
| v | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s` |
| r | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s` |
| s | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v` |

### selfPermitAllowed
```solidity
selfPermitAllowed(address token, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external payable
```
Details: Same as SelfPermit but not abstract
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| token | address | The address of the token spent |
| nonce | uint256 | The current nonce of the owner |
| expiry | uint256 | The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid |
| v | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s` |
| r | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s` |
| s | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v` |

### selfPermitAllowedIfNecessary
```solidity
selfPermitAllowedIfNecessary(address token, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external payable
```
Details: Same as SelfPermit but not abstract
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| token | address | The address of the token spent |
| nonce | uint256 | The current nonce of the owner |
| expiry | uint256 | The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid |
| v | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s` |
| r | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s` |
| s | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v` |

```
Details: Same as SelfPermit but not abstract
#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| token | address | The address of the token spent |
| value | uint256 | The amount that can be spent of token |
| deadline | uint256 | A timestamp, the current blocktime must be less than or equal to this timestamp |
| v | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s` |
