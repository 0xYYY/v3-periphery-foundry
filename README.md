This repository contains the periphery smart contracts for the Uniswap V3 Protocol.
For the lower level core contracts, see the [uniswap-v3-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core)
repository.

## Foundry Modification

This repository has been modified to also support Foundry Solidity tests

If you already have Foundry's `forge` installed, first install the dependencies with `yarn`, and then simply
run `forge test` to run the Solidity tests under `contracts/foundry-tests`.

### Installing Foundry

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:

```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Serve Documents
The contents in `docs` is generated by running `forge doc` with this [WIP fork](https://github.com/0xYYY/foundry/tree/0xyyy/forge-doc).

Currently, documents can be served with `mdbook`:
1. Install [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html).
2. Run `mdbook serve docs`.
3. Open `localhost:3000` in the browser.


## Bug bounty

This repository is subject to the Uniswap V3 bug bounty program,
per the terms defined [here](./bug-bounty.md).

## Local deployment

In order to deploy this code to a local testnet, you should install the npm package
`@uniswap/v3-periphery`
and import bytecode imported from artifacts located at
`@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/contracts/*/*.json`.
For example:

```typescript
import {
  abi as SWAP_ROUTER_ABI,
  bytecode as SWAP_ROUTER_BYTECODE,
} from '@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/contracts/SwapRouter.sol/SwapRouter.json'

// deploy the bytecode
```

This will ensure that you are testing against the same bytecode that is deployed to
mainnet and public testnets, and all Uniswap code will correctly interoperate with
your local deployment.

## Using solidity interfaces

The Uniswap v3 periphery interfaces are available for import into solidity smart contracts
via the npm artifact `@uniswap/v3-periphery`, e.g.:

```solidity
import '@uniswap/v3-periphery/contracts/interfaces/ISwapRouter.sol';

contract MyContract {
  ISwapRouter router;

  function doSomethingWithSwapRouter() {
    // router.exactInput(...);
  }
}

```
